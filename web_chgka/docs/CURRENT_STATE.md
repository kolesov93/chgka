# CHGKA Web Current State

- Snapshot date: 2026-08-04
- Active task: `docs/tasks/0006-pack-validator.md`
- Task base: `036fb3d` (`Merge dependency toolchain task`)

## Product decisions

- The web version is the target product.
- The parent Pyglet/VLC application is legacy and does not need continued support.
- The target environment is the public internet.
- Keeping the current localhost connection during development is acceptable. Production connectivity, HTTPS, origins, and secret management belong to a dedicated deployment task.
- Completed task branches are integrated into `web` only after automated checks and manual browser acceptance.

## Verified baseline

- Backend: 80 tests pass.
  - 47 question parser tests;
  - 4 state helper tests;
  - 3 wheel-sector/spin-selection tests;
  - 14 pure transition tests;
  - 3 handler concurrency/session tests;
  - 9 pack-validator CLI, sector-directory, and media-path tests.
- Frontend: `npm run build` succeeds.
- Backend startup loads the sample pack with all 13 questions and reaches application startup completion.
- `docker compose config --quiet` succeeds without warnings.
- The game-transitions history includes the development media-origin fix found during manual smoke testing.

The accepted dependency/toolchain baseline has clean-install and container checks, and all three GitHub Actions jobs pass remotely. Pack-validator remote acceptance is pending.

## Active task: pack validator

The task is documented in `docs/tasks/0006-pack-validator.md` on branch `task/pack-validator`. Local implementation and automated verification are complete; remote CI and minimal browser acceptance remain.

Implemented:

- added `python -m validate_pack /path/to/pack` with stable human-readable output and exit codes 0/1/2;
- reused the backend startup parser instead of creating a second validation path;
- rejected extra two-digit numeric sectors, absolute media paths, traversal, and symlinks escaping a question folder;
- documented pack structure, frontmatter, sections, blitz/superblitz, media rules, CLI usage, and raw-HTML trust limitations.

Local verification:

- all 80 backend tests pass with warnings treated as errors;
- sample-pack CLI output reports the expected question, part, and media counts;
- clean frontend install, full npm audit, and production build pass with zero vulnerabilities;
- backend image build, CLI, dependency check, all tests, and sample-pack startup pass in Python 3.14;
- Compose configuration validates without warnings.

Acceptance still required: all three GitHub Actions jobs and a minimal two-browser smoke covering admin/player login, pack info, and game start with the sample pack.

## Completed task: dependency and toolchain refresh

The task is documented in `docs/tasks/0005-dependency-toolchain-refresh.md` on branch `task/dependency-toolchain-refresh`. Implementation, automated verification, remote CI, and focused browser regression acceptance are complete.

Implemented:

- upgraded Vite/plugin-react to 8.2.0/6.0.5 while keeping React 18 and Tailwind CSS 3;
- upgraded FastAPI/Uvicorn/Python Socket.IO to 0.141.1/0.52.1/5.16.3 while leaving Starlette and AnyIO transitively managed by FastAPI;
- added full npm audit, pip dependency checks, and Python warnings-as-errors to CI.

Local verification:

- clean npm install, full audit, and production build pass with zero vulnerabilities;
- clean Python install, `pip check`, and all 71 warnings-as-errors tests pass;
- both Docker images build;
- the frontend build passes in Node.js 24;
- backend dependency checks, all tests, and sample-pack startup pass in Python 3.14;
- an isolated cross-container Socket.IO websocket handshake succeeds;
- Compose configuration validates without warnings.

Acceptance: all three remote GitHub Actions jobs and the focused two-browser smoke pass.

## Completed task: frontend decomposition

The task is documented in `docs/tasks/0004-frontend-decomposition.md` on branch `task/frontend-decomposition`. The implementation, automated checks, remote CI, and focused browser regression smoke are complete.

Implemented:

- reduced `frontend/src/App.jsx` from 899 to 156 lines, leaving phase routing and layout at the top level;
- centralized backend/media URLs and the Socket.IO singleton in `frontend/src/socket.js`;
- moved session state/event wiring, discussion timing, and sound-event bridging into dedicated hooks;
- extracted admin question/media, admin controls, shared media, header, and notification components;
- preserved existing Socket.IO event names, payloads, storage keys, confirmations, and state ownership.

Verification:

- clean frontend install and production build pass;
- all 71 backend tests pass;
- Compose validation passes without warnings.
- all three GitHub Actions jobs pass;
- the focused two-browser smoke covering login/session restore, normal and blitz controls, discussion timing/sounds, media preview/share/hide, moderation/logout, and reset during spin passes.

## Completed task: Build and CI

The task is documented in `docs/tasks/0003-build-ci.md` on branch `task/build-ci`. Local clean-environment checks, container checks, and the remote backend/frontend/Compose CI jobs all pass.

Implemented:

- committed `frontend/package-lock.json` and standardized clean frontend installs on `npm ci`;
- refreshed dependencies within existing semver ranges, removing all production `npm audit` findings;
- declared backend test dependencies in `backend/requirements-dev.txt`;
- added path-filtered GitHub Actions jobs for backend tests, frontend build, and Compose validation;
- moved development images to Node.js 24 and Python 3.14;
- added backend/frontend `.dockerignore` files and removed the obsolete Compose `version` field;
- kept Docker/Compose explicitly development-only.

Local verification:

- clean frontend install and production build pass;
- clean backend install and all 71 tests pass;
- both Docker images build;
- frontend build passes in the Node.js 24 image;
- all 71 backend tests pass in the Python 3.14 image with fixtures mounted read-only;
- Compose validation passes without warnings.

The Vite/esbuild audit findings and Python 3.14 dependency warnings discovered in this task are resolved by the completed dependency/toolchain refresh.

## Implemented

- Player and admin login, session tokens, reconnect, pending approval, kick, and logout.
- Shared server-authoritative game state and phase-based UI.
- Wheel animation, random/forced selection, used-sector skipping, and sector 13 handling.
- Normal, blitz, and superblitz rounds.
- Scoring, discussion deadline, shared sounds, and admin logs.
- Strict parsing of 13-question packs with Markdown sections and media validation.
- Admin question card and image preview/share through temporary media tokens.
- Internal state split into `game`, `wheel`, `timer`, `presentation`, `pack`, and `logs`, while retaining the current flat frontend payload.

## Completed task: game transitions

The task is documented in `docs/tasks/0002-game-transitions.md`. Implementation, automated verification, and the complete two-browser smoke test have passed.

Completed:

- introduced the domain-oriented `AppState`;
- migrated `backend/main.py` to the new state shape;
- retained frontend wire compatibility;
- covered state construction, reset, and serialization helpers.
- added synchronous transitions for start, spin start/completion, discussion, answer, scoring, blitz progression, round end, and reset;
- added explicit transport effects for logs, sounds, media-token cleanup, state broadcasts, and admin-question refresh;
- added internal `spin_id` generation so reset invalidates sleeping spin completion;
- made scoring phase mutation happen before any network await;
- fixed pending-player reconnect to remain pending;
- added pure transition and handler-level concurrency/session tests.

Scope decision: task 0002 builds a reliable transition layer while preserving the current product behavior. The new `GAME_OVER` phase remains roadmap task 12. The transition API must be extensible so that task 12 can add the phase without moving game rules back into Socket.IO handlers.

## Resolved defects

The first three scenarios were reproduced against the old handlers and now have regression tests. The fourth was found during manual browser acceptance:

1. Concurrent `admin_score` calls now award one point; the later transition is rejected after the first moves the phase to `POST_ROUND`.
2. Reset increments `spin_id`; obsolete spin completion is ignored and the game remains reset.
3. A pending player who reconnects receives `join_pending` and keeps the pending flag.
4. Admin media previews and shared player images now use the backend origin in development; previously relative `/media/...` URLs were incorrectly requested from Vite on port 5173.

Additional known gaps:

- after the sixth point, there is no `GAME_OVER`; normal round end returns to `PRE_ROUND`, while further spin is silently rejected;
- admin tokens have no TTL and older generated tokens are not centrally revoked;
- all runtime state is lost on backend restart;
- wildcard CORS and the default admin password are development-only security;
- raw Markdown HTML is unsafe for untrusted question packs;
- frontend development uses `localhost:8000`, so it does not yet support browsers running on other machines;
- media sharing is image-only even though the parser recognizes audio and video;
- sample question 03 provides the concrete audio regression case for the managed media-flow task;
- live ops has no server-synchronized three-second fade action next to `Silence`;
- there are no frontend tests, Socket.IO integration tests, or lint/typecheck.

## Repository artifacts

No Cursor-specific files remain. The useful continuity artifacts are `ROADMAP.md` and `docs/tasks/`.

Untracked files outside `web_chgka` belong to the legacy workspace. In particular, `questions/` contains about 88 MB of media and must not be treated as disposable. `intro_2024/` and the three root gong files duplicate tracked frontend assets, but should still be left untouched unless repository cleanup is explicitly requested.

Within `web_chgka`, ignored `frontend/node_modules`, `frontend/dist`, and Python/pytest caches are local build artifacts. `frontend/package-lock.json` is now the committed source of truth for reproducible frontend installs.

## Recommended continuation

1. Push the task 0005 closing commit and merge commit, then push `task/pack-validator`.
2. Require all three GitHub Actions jobs to pass on the pack-validator branch.
3. Run the minimal two-browser sample-pack smoke; if accepted, close task 0006 and merge it into `web`.

## Resume checklist

```bash
git status --short --branch
```

Then read, in order:

1. `AGENTS.md`;
2. this file;
3. the next item in `ROADMAP.md`;
4. `docs/tasks/0006-pack-validator.md` for the active task, then tasks 0005, 0004, 0003, and 0002 for the latest completed work;
5. `backend/state.py` and the game handlers in `backend/main.py`.

Before changing code, rerun:

```bash
cd backend && python3 -m pytest -q
cd ../frontend && npm ci && npm run build
```
